// TODO
// Replace XX with your group number.
// You may have to add other interfaces such as for threading, etc., as needed.
// This class will contain the logic for both your manager process as well as the worker processes.
//  Make sure that the callbacks and watch do not conflict between your manager's logic and worker's logic.
//		This is important as both the manager and worker may need same kind of callbacks and could result
//			with the same callback functions.
//	For simplicity, so far all the code in a single class (including the callbacks).
//		You are free to break it apart into multiple classes, if that is your programming style or helps
//		you manage the code more modularly.
//	REMEMBER !! Managers and Workers are also clients of ZK and the ZK client library is single thread - Watches & CallBacks should not be used for time consuming tasks.
//		In particular, if the process is a worker, Watches & CallBacks should only be used to assign the "work" to a separate thread inside your program.
